# In this project, you will to saw my second game built with JavaScript/Html/Css/Bootstrap
 I made this project to work some JS animations together with an improvement of my CSS
 <br>
 The game is very simple, just clone the repository, access the views folder and start with server(Live Serv) 

# About the future of the project:
 As it's just a game to practice and understand more concepts. I've decided that I won't bring new updates, {not for now}
 <br>
 It is intended to put the game on a server, as soon as it is necessary to clone the other device for access
 <br>
 As soon as this is done, I will give an update here, allocating the link to access the game.
